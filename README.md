# Technometrics-Coding-Challenge



### Used Steps 
1. Data Preprocessing 
2. Data Cleaning 
3. Data Visualization (word-cloud, bar-plot, )
4. Training 
5. Evaluation 
6. Testing 

### Used Technique 
1. Bag-of-Words (CountVectorizer)
2. Deep Learning
3. pretrained Pipeline of Spark NLP
4. pretrained model like BERT

### Used Algorithms 
1. Count Vectorizer 
2. TfidfVectorizer 
3. MultinomialNB 
4. SGDClassifier 

### Used Hyperparameter Tuning Algorithms
1. GridSearchCV

### Used Pretrained Model 
1. Bengali BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) 



## Future Task 

#### For Hyperparameter Tuning
1. use RandomSearch (for small amount of hyperparameter)
2. use Bayesian Optimization (for huge number of hyperparameter)
3. Keras-Tuner for hyperparameter tuning 

#### For CI(continuous integration)/ CD(continuous development)/ CT(continuous training) Pipeline 
1. use TFX (Tensorflow Extension) when building project with tensorflow 


#### popular library for building project in a short time 
1. PyCaret 
2. Auto NLP 
3. TFX 
4. Spacy 
5. Allen NLP


### Note: 
1. I gave priority to applying different approach of AI. For this some models accuracy is not so good. 
2. I don't have GPU for training a large model like BERT. For this I worked in Google Colab with a limitation of GPU service.
